1. Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: 
You are sitting in a room with 15 people. 
You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. 
So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. 
You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. 
Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

    - constant O(1) you perform one action by yelling and you either recieve a response or not

2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: 
You are sitting in a room with 15 people. 
You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. 
So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. 
You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. 
He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, 
and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

    - linear O(n) you're asking each person once so you're scaling the problem linearly.
      It will take you longer to ask 50 people that it will to ask 10
